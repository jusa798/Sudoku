# Sudoku

This Sudoku web-app was created using React, React Hooks, and Redux. It includes 10 hard-coded matches generated by the gnome-sudoku software listed through http://www.opensky.ca/~jdhildeb/software/sudokugen/. 

A live version is on my website jrbeltran.com. To run locally, clone the repository and install the package.json through npm using `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.

## How it's written


### App.js

The app lives within this file. 

### Index.js
Index.js is used to render `<App>` and also holds the redux store. Through redux, the app maintains a state of the currently incorrect/correct squares to make them light up red/green. 

  Note: The squares only light up green when the entire puzzle is solved. 

### Components

`<Sudoku Board>` holds all 81 squares and the Submit and New Game buttons. It maintains a state that holds the current games initial starting and solved positions. It also holds the state of the current incorrect squares, mainly to update the redux store and individual squares. 

`<Square>` manages the rendering of each square, and its current state of incorrect, normal, or solved.
