# Sudoku

This Sudoku web-app was created using React, React Hooks, and Redux. It includes 10 hard-coded matches generated by the gnome-sudoku software listed through http://www.opensky.ca/~jdhildeb/software/sudokugen/. 

A live version is on my website jrbeltran.com. 

## How it's written

The app lives within App.js. Index.js is used to render `<App>` and also hold the redux store.
